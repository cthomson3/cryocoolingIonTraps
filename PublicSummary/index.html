  <h1>About The Project </h1>
  <p> Hi, my name is Christopher Thomson, and I would like to thank you for coming to my MPhys Public Summary website.
     This site is designed to give a brief overview of what I have been doing as
    part of my MPhys project and to provide a source of further information on the area of ion trapping.
    The content on this site is designed to be broadly understood by someone with physics knowledge below Advanced Higher level. 
   </p>
   <br>
    <p>
    Since September, I have been working with the University's Nuclear Physics department - with supervision from Dr Pascal Reiter - to explore the cryogenic cooling
    of a novel printed circuit board (PCB) radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) ion traps. That may sound like jargon, but by
the time you leave this website, you will likely gain an insight into what this entails.

  <h2> Why Do We Care About Trapping Ions?</h2>
  <p>Many areas of modern physics require extremely precise measurements; To make these measurements, scientists often need to hold tiny charged particles still.</p>
<br><p>However, atoms and ions naturally move around very quickly. The more they move around, the harder it is to make precise measurements of their properties. 
  By trapping them and reducing their motion, we can measure their properties far more precisely.</p> <br>
  <p> Ion traps are used in research areas such as: nuclear physics, precision measurements, and in the development of quantum computing.</p>
</div>


<div class = "section">
  <h2>What is an Ion Trap?</h2>
 <p>Ion traps help researchers understand how the centres of atoms,
    called nuclei, behave. They also help us learn how different elements are created inside stars through nuclear reactions. An ion trap is a device that controls the movement of charged particles, using electricity. </p> <br>
 <p> Ions are atoms which have gained or lost one or more electrons; giving them an electric charge. As ions are charged,
  they can be controlled using electric fields. An ion trap uses carefully designed electric fields to hold these particles
  in a small region in space, like an invisible cage made of electric forces. </p> <br>
  <p>By keeping the ions trapped and nearly motionless, physicists can study their behaviour with extreme detail;
    allowing precise measurements of their properties to be taken. 
    Below you can see images of a classic ion trap and the ion trap used in this project.</p>

  <h2>What is a PCB RFQ?</h2>

  <p> A PCB RFQ was the main type of ion trap used in the project.</p>
  <br><p> <b> PCB</b> stands for printed circuit board. This is the same technology used in most everyday electronic devices, 
    from smartphones to washing machines, allowing us to control the ions trapped inside easily. Using PCBs allows the trap to 
    be manufactured in a cheap, compact, and precise manner.</p>
  <br><p> <b>RFQ</b> stands for radio-frequency quadrupole. RF refers to electrical signals that change direction very rapidly inside the trap. 
    Quadrupole refers to the arrangement of the electrodes inside the trap, creating the electric field, which is designed to push ions back into the centre of the trap. These rapidly changing, highly structured electric fields create a 
    stable trapping region in the centre of the device, confining ions.</p>
</div>
<div class = "section2">
  <h2>How Does Cooling to Extremely Low Temperatures Affect Ions?</h2>
  
  <p>At high temperatures, particles move quickly and erratically. As we lower the temperature, their motion becomes slower. Even when particles are trapped in an ion trap, 
    they still vibrate and move slightly.</p> <br>
    <p>Cooling the trap reduces this motion. The slower the particles move, the easier they are to control and measure precisely.</p>
  <br><p>The animation below shows a simplified model of how ion motion changes as temperature decreases. As a note, to convert a temperature from Kelvin (K) to Celsius (°C), subtract 273 from the Kelvin value. 
    Use the slider to adjust the temperature and observe how the movement changes.</p>

  <h2>How to Reach Cryogenic Temperatures?</h2> 
  <p>Now that we seen why cryogenic ion traps are needed, you may be wondering: "How can we cool our trap to temperatures that low?" The following video, by Sunpower Inc, shows an animation explaining how our cryocooler works (this link will open in a new tab):
 <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSJFPb8030g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  How does a Sunpower Cryocooler Work? - YouTube</a></p>


<br><p> In ideal conditions, the Sunpower cryocooler can achieve temperatures as low as 40 Kelvin, about -230°C, which is roughly 12 times as cold as a typical household freezer. 
  So in the same way that a freezer left open cannot cool its contents, 
  the cryocooler must be kept in a vacuum with limited contact points to prevent heat from entering the system. 
</p></div>
<div class = "section2">
  <h2>What Are the Challenges and What Comes Next?</h2>
  <p>Cooling the ion trap to cryogenic temperatures has proven to be more difficult than expected. Although the cryocooler itself is capable of reaching very low temperatures, 
    cooling the trap has been challenging; any small path for heat to enter the system can significantly reduce our ability to cool the trap.
    </p><br><p> One key issue is how efficiently heat can move through different materials. 
    The PCB that forms the ion trap does not transfer heat quickly, so it cools slowly. In contrast, 
    the aluminium support structures conduct heat much more effectively, therefore bringing unwanted heat into the system from the outside environment. 
    Improving how heat flows through the system, for example by redesigning the thermal contact points, could allow us to reach lower temperatures more reliably.
    </p><br><p> Although reaching stable cryogenic temperatures remains a challenge, understanding these limitations has been an important outcome of the project. 
    By improving the cooling design, these PCB-based ion traps could become a compact, cost-effective tool for future high-precision experiments in nuclear physics and beyond.</p>
